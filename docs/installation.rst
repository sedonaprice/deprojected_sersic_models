From Source
-----------

``sersic_profile_mass_VC`` can be installed from source.
Before installing the package, you will need to install python (v3)
and the dependent packages.

.. tip::
    To handle dependencies (and possible dependency clashes for different packages),
    we recommend using a separate python environment (such as an Anaconda python environment).

    The Anaconda `installation`_ and `environments`_ guides lead through the necessary steps
    to create a new Anaconda python environment.

.. _installation: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html
.. _environments: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html



From a terminal, change directories to where the package was downloaded
and type:

.. code-block:: console

    $ tar zxvf sersic_profile_mass_VC-N.N.N.tar.gz
    $ cd sersic_profile_mass_VC-N.N.N
    $ python setup.py install

N.N.N is the current version. After the installation is complete, you should
be able to run `import sersic_profile_mass_VC` within python (including IPython or a Jupyter notebook).
